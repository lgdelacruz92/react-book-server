# Chapter 2.1: React Elements and Components - The Magical Foundations
<br><br>

## Introduction
<br>

As we embark on our quest to explore the enchanting land of Reactopia, we must first familiarize ourselves with the magical foundations of this realm - React elements and components. These mystical entities serve as the very bedrock of every spellbinding application conjured in Reactopia. In this chapter, we shall delve into the arcane secrets of React elements and components and provide you with a series of challenges to test your newfound knowledge.
<br><br>

## React Elements - The Enchanted Scrolls
<br>

React elements are the enchanted scrolls upon which the secrets of your user interface are inscribed. These lightweight, immutable descriptions hold the key to your application's appearance and behavior at any given moment.
<br><br>

## Observe, a simple React element:
<br>

```jsx
const element = <h1>Welcome, brave adventurer!</h1>;
```
<br><br>

In this example, element is a React element representing an `<h1>` tag that greets valiant explorers venturing into the realm of Reactopia.
<br><br>

## Challenge Quests for React Elements:
<br>

- Weave a React element representing a paragraph that whispers an ancient riddle.

- Conjure a React element representing an unordered list of three enchanted relics.

## React Components - The Spellbinding Constructs
<br>

React components are the spellbinding constructs that bind your enchanted scrolls into a powerful, cohesive grimoire. These mystical beings come in two forms: functional and class-based, each possessing its own unique set of incantations.
<br><br>

## Functional Components:
<br>

Functional components are the swift and agile scribes of Reactopia, simple JavaScript functions that return a single React element.
<br><br>

## Behold, a functional component:
<br>

```jsx
function Greetings() {
  return <h1>Welcome, brave adventurer!</h1>;
}
```

<br><br>

## Class Components:
<br>

Class components are the wise and ancient enchanters of Reactopia, versed in the arcane arts of state management and lifecycle incantations.
<br><br>

## Behold, a class component:
<br>

```jsx
class Greetings extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Welcome, brave adventurer!</h1>;
  }
}
```

<br><br>

## Challenge Quests for React Components:
<br>

- Forge a functional component that returns a React element representing a mystic button inscribed with the words "Awaken the spirits!".
<br><br>

- Craft a class component that returns a React element representing a crystal ball with a given src and alt attribute.
